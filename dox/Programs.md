# Programs
Simple applications can consist of just a single class with a Main entry method, and all of the code in the application resides in that class. As your applications get larger and more sophisticated, you add additional classes. Eventually, you find that there is common code you want to execute in several forms. You cannot invoke subroutines in one form from another, and you do not want to duplicate the code in both forms. 

Common code can be placed in a single procedural program, and [**CALL**](CALL.html)ed from each form. Over time, you can build up a library of code containing useful, common subroutines. 

Each procedural program and form program can contain the following. 

[**Declarations**](Declarations.html) 

[**General Subroutines**](General_Subroutines.html) 

[**Mainline Code**](Mainline_Code.html)
