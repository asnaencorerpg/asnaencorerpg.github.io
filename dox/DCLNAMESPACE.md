Declares a namespace, which organizes the objects defined in an assembly.

```

 **DCLNAMESPACE<br />Name** (Character Expression)
```

### Parts

**Name** 

Required. The namespace to allocate for this application.


### Remarks
At a top level, *namespaces* are entities that organize other entities, such as nested namespaces and types. *Types* are entities that describe values and define executable code. Types may contain nested types and type members. *Type members* are constants, variables, methods, properties, events, enumeration values, and constructors. The declaration space of a namespace is "open ended," so two namespace declarations with the same fully qualified name contribute to the same declaration space.
