Help in Encore RPG is tightly integrated with the Visual Studio development environment (IDE), in an effort to provide you with the information you need based on the context of your development effort. 

**While working in the integrated development environment (IDE)** , use the F1 key to display reference topics based on the user interface elements you select or error messages you see. F1 Help displays reference topics based on the UI elements you select or the error messages you see. 

**While you are designing objects and coding their functionality** , the editors can offer statement completion that presents the syntax information you need for language keywords, methods, and properties. If you want to examine the functionality of a library or object more broadly, you can use the Object Browser. If you want even more information about the usage and capabilities of a particular language element, you can use F1 Help to display the language reference topic. 

**When the Dynamic Help window and F1 Help do not meet your needs** , you can use the Keyword index, Full-Text Search, and Table of Contents.
