An **indicator** is any field declared using the *IND simple type. *ON, *OFF are indicator literals. 

### Remarks
In Encore RPG, an indicator array *IN is automatically defined for each program. Individual elements can be accessed using the array element syntax ([ ] or by using the predefined names *IN01, *IN02, â€¦ etc. The *IN array is 99 long. 

*INLR is another special predefined indicator that is used to determine the program end, if the program should be unloaded.
