The logical operators ```*BitAnd``` and ```*BitOr``` are used to perform a logical disjunction on two Boolean expressions, or a bitwise disjunction on two integer values. The ```*BitAnd``` and ```*BitOr``` operators take two operands. The ```*BitNot``` operator specifies the result of a bitwise ```NOT``` operation performed on a numeric value. The ```*BitNot``` operator takes a single operand. <p> The ```*BitNot``` operator specifies the result of a bitwise ```NOT``` operation performed on a numeric value. If the numeric value is not an integer, it is converted to an integer before its bits are shifted. 

The ```*BitAnd``` operator performs a logical conjunction on two Boolean expressions, or a bitwise conjunction on two integer values. For Boolean comparisons, the result is the logical conjunction of two expressions. For bitwise operations, the result is a numeric value resulting from the bitwise conjunction of two numeric expressions. 

The ```*BitOr``` operator performs a logical disjunction on two Boolean expressions, or a bitwise disjunction on two integer values. For Boolean comparisons, the result is the logical disjunction of two expressions. For bitwise operations the result is a numeric value resulting from the bitwise disjunction of two numeric expressions.
