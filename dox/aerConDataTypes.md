The ***data type*** of a programming element refers to what kind of data it can hold and how that data is stored. Data types apply to all values that can be stored in computer memory or participate in the evaluation of an expression. Every variable, literal, constant, property, procedure argument, and procedure return value has a data type. 

A ***declared data type*** is specified as part of the declaration of a programming element. Unless you use typeless programming, you must declare data types for all your programming elements. 

This section describes the declaration and use of Encore RPG data types.
