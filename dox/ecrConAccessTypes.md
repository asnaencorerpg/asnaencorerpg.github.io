A declaration specifies the **access type** of the entity it declares. An entity's access type does not change the scope of an entity's name. 

To specify an access type, use the **Access** keyword for any of the [declaration op codes](ecrConDeclarationOpCodes.html). The four access types of the **Access** keyword are * **Public, *Private, *Protected, and *Internal.** * **Public** is the most permissive access type, and the other three types are all subsets of * **Public** . 

The default **Access** type is *PRIVATE, indicating that the entity being declared will not be shared. 

- *PRIVATE (default) - access is accessible only from within their declaration context, including from members of any nested types, for example from within a nested procedure or from an assignment expression in a nested enumeration.
- *PUBLIC - access is accessible from anywhere within the same project, from other projects that reference the project, and from an assembly built from the project.
- *PROTECTED - access is accessible only from within the same class, or from a class derived from this class.
- *INTERNAL - access is accessible from within the same project, but not from outside the project.

The accessibility in a declaration does not depend on the accessibility of the declaration context. For example, a type declared with * **Private** access may contain a type member with * **Public** access.
