The **Main** procedure, or **mainline code** is the "starting point" for your application, or the first procedure that is accessed when you run your code. **Main** is where you would put the code that needs to be accessed first, and are not part of any subroutine, such as [Declarations](Declarations.html). 

In **Main** , you can determine:

- which form is loaded first when the program is started
- find out if a copy of your application is already running on the system
- establish a set of variables for your application
- open a database that the application requires

**Main** <u> **must be** </u> either a [BEGSR](BEGSR.html) or a [BEGFUNC](BEGFUNC.html) with ***Integer4** type, such as: 

``` BegFunc Main Type( *Integer4 ) Access( *Public ) Shared( *Yes ) ``` 

**Note** If **Type** is not *Integer4 you will receive a compiler error stating "Main not foundâ€¦". 

It may have one [DCLSRPARM](DCLSRPARM.html), and the type of the parm **<u>must be</u>** a *String RANK(1) array 

```
DclSRParm Args Type( *string ) Rank( 1 )
```
