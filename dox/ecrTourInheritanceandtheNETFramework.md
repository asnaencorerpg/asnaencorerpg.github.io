Encore RPG .NET applications can use many of the classes found in the .NET Framework as base classes. Attribute classes, for instance, are always based on the class **```System.Attribute```** . Other useful .NET Framework base classes include **```System.ComponentModel.Component```** , which is inherited from to define components, and **```System.Exception```** , which is inherited from to define custom exception classes. 

The .NET Framework ensures compatibility between classes created with different programming languages. Encore RPG .NET classes can extend, or inherit from classes in assemblies created by any language supported by Visual Studio. The classes you create in Encore RPG .NET can also be used as base classes by other .NET programming languages.
