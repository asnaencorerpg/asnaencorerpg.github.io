**Date operations** allow you to extract portions of a date, time or timestamp field, perform date and time arithmetic; or test for valid date and time fields. 

The date operation codes are used for date, time, timestamp fields, and character and numeric fields representing dates, times and timestamps. 

The date operation codes are:

[ADDDUR](ADDHANDLER.html)

Add a duration to a date or time.


[EXTRACT](EXTRACT.html)

Extract part of a date, time or timestamp.


[SUBDUR](SUBDUR.html)

Subtract a duration from a date or time, or calculate the duration between 2
                dates, times or timestamps.


[TESTTIME](TESTTIME.html)

Test for a valid date, time, or timestamp field.
