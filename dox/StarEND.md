***END** positions the file at the **end** of the file, so the [READP](READP.html) returns the last record of the file. 

It is also used in conjunction with [*START](START.html), which positions the file at the **beginning** of file, so the [READ](READ.html) returns the 1st record. 

***END/*START** is available with [SETLL](SETLL.html) and [SETGT](SETGT.html).
