The * **String** data type (unicode) allows you to pass a parameter to a procedure even though the data type is not precisely known to the called procedure, (for example, different types of strings). In these instances you can use operational descriptors to provide descriptive information to the called procedure regarding the form of the parameter. The additional information allows the procedure to properly interpret the string. You should only use operational descriptors when they are expected by the called procedure.
