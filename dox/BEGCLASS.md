```c

Name (ClassName)

Modifier (<u>*EXTENSIBLE</u>| *NOTEXTENSIBLE | *MUSTEXTEND)
Extends (ClassName)
Implements (interface1, interface2, ...)

DatEdit (<u>*DFT</u> | *YMD | *MDY | *DMY)
UsesCycle (<u>*NO</u> | *YES)
```

### Parameters

#### Name

Required. Defines the name of the class.

#### Access

Optional. Allows the contents of the class to be accessed either only internally by other classes in the same assembly (exe or dll), or to the "outside world". `*Public` is the default.

- `*Public` â€“ class is accessible to the "outside" world, that is, it can be referenced by any other assembly.
- `*Internal` - class is accessible only by other classes in the current assembly.

#### Modifier

Optional. Modifier controls how properties and methods are overridden in derived classes. `*Extensible` is the default.

- `*Extensible` (default) - specifies that other classes can be defined to extend this class. The new class is called a derived class.
- `*MustExtend` - specifies that non-shared members of this class cannot be used on its own. The class only provides a set of fields, properties, events and methods as the basis to derive new classes. nstances of *MustExtende classes cannot be created.
- `*NotExtensible` - specifies that this class cannot be extended in a new derived class. No further inheritance is allowed from this class.

#### Extends

Optional. Identifies the name of the base class to extend, such as System.Windows.Forms.Form. The new class inherits all the members of the base class.

#### Implements

Optional. Indicates that this class implements the members of an interface. An interface defines a set of properties, events and methods, but does not provide an implementation of them, just a definition. You must implement every member of every interface you specify in this keyword.

#### Attributes

Optional. Allows you to provide one or more attributes that apply to this class. To specify more than one attribute, simply separate them with commas.

#### Partial

Optional. Indicates if the class is partial, (that is, declared in parts); possibly in different source files. All the parts of a partial class must use Partial(`*Yes`). `*No` is the default.

#### DatEdit

Optional. Indicates the default date format in use for this class. If not given, the class uses the [project's default date format](ecrVsProjConfig.html#default-datedit-format).

#### UsesCycle

### Remarks

A class declaration must end with an [EndClass](ENDCLASS.html) command, which must be the last command in the class.

### Example

The following is an example of **BegClass**:

```c
Using System
Using ASNA.QSys.Runtime
Using ASNA.QSys.Runtime.JobSupport

BegClass CHECKDIGIT_Class Extends(Module) Access(*Public) +
  Attributes(System.ComponentModel.Description("Check if string has only digits"))

  DclFld Digits Type(*Char) Len(10) Inz("0123456789")
  DclFld JustDigits Type(*Ind)

  ...

EndClass
```
