* **NOT** or **~** , is an operator to be used in expressions to determine if the opposite condition is true. 

### Remarks
Any number of parentheses ( ) can be used to force the precedence of any operator. The deepest levels of parentheses will be evaluated first, until the whole expression is evaluated. 

All of the mathematical operands, such as -, +, /, *, and ** are valid only for numeric values, except for the "+". The "+" will also do a concatenate if the two operands are character strings. 

### Example

```
  IF (*NOT (A=B *AND <+D))      
```
