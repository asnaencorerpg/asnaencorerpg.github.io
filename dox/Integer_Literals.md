An **integer** **literal** is a numeric literal that does not contain a decimal point. It is a zoned number with 0 decimals. 

You can also specify an "i' after the integer to indicate an integer constant. This adds support for the conversion of fixed decimal numbers with 0 decimal positions to any of the integral types. 

A constant without the "i" will work fine in every context where an integer is required. 

### Example
The following are examples of valid inter constants:

```
MyNumeric = 35 
MyNumeric = 35i
```
