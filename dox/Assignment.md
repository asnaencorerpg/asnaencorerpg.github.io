An **assignment** defines or reassigns the contents of a field. An **assignment** copies the value of an expression into a field left-adjusted with padding on the right with blanks if the field is a character field, and right-adjusted with a zero pad if the field is numeric. 

#### For Example:

```
  Array [2, x+1] = Data struct.Field1 + control.property
  Numeric = Binary-Packed[5,2]
```
