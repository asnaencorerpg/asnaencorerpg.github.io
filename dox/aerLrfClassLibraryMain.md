Encore RPG programs rely on a class library for their execution. contains a few of its own library of classes, interfaces, and value types that are included in Encore RPG. This library also provides access to system functionality and contains links to the .NET Framework classes in which applications, components, and controls are built. 

### Namespaces
The Encore RPG class library provides the following namespaces:

[ASNA.VisualRPG.Runtime](aerLrfRuntimeNamespace.html)

Contains classes that support compilation and code generation using the
                Encore RPG .NET language.


[ASNA.VisualRPG.Windows.Controls](aerLrfVisualRPGWindowsControlNamespace.html)

            System.Data

                to build components that efficiently manage data from multiple data
                sources.  In a disconnected scenario (such
                as the Internet), ADO.NET provides the tools to request, update, and reconcile data in multiple tier systems. 
                The ADO.NET architecture is also implemented in client applications, such as Windows Forms, or HTML pages created by ASP.NET.
