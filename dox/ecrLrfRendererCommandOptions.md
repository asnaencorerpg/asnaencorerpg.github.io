ASNA's Print File Renderer ( **Renderer.exe** ) is called automatically when you close a print file (when itâ€™s a manuscript file only). 

Parameters available for Renderer.exe and their function: 

**/m:"file"** // Manuscript Path ( **required** ). 

**/d** // Delete manuscript file after rendering is complete. 

**/q** // Quiet printing. This hides the print preview window and just prints directly. 

**/r:"page range"** // Specify page numbers and/or page ranges separated by commas (i.e. 1,3,5-12, *last). 

**/h or /?** // Displays help on parameter usage. 

### General Rules
The above parameters can be specified in any order. 

- **"file"**  is a path to the manuscript to be rendered.  It
                can be relative to the Renderer.exe's location, and **is always required** 
                .  The " *file*  " specified can contain the relative or full
                path.  For instance, if you are executing the renderer from  the same
                directory as the manuscript, just the manuscript file name is necessary.
                For instance. **"myManuscript.apm"**  as a relative path
                versus **"C:\myReports\myManuscript.apm"**  as a full
                path. **/m:** 
                is required ONLY when any of the other following options are also
                used.
- If **/d**  is not specified, the manuscript file will **not** 
                be deleted after rendering is complete.
- If **/q** 
                is not specified, the print preview window will display to allow for the
                reported to be previewed.
- If **/r:"page range"**  is not specified, **all** 
                pages will be printed or previewed.  To select single pages, separate
                each page number with a comma. **/r:"1,3"**  will
                print pages 1 and 3.  To specify a range of pages, enter the first
                and last page numbers separated with a dash. **/r:"1-3"**  will
                print pages 1, 2, and 3.<br />
The ***last** keyword refers to the last page of the document. In addition, you can specify arithmetic operations on ***last** in order to print pages **relative** to the last page. For instance **/r:"*last-2** " will print the second to the last page, while **/r:"*last-4 - *last** " prints the last 5 pages. 

A combinations of single page and a range of pages can be specified. **/r:"1-3, 5,9, *last"** will print pages 1, 2, 3, 5, 9, and the last page.

### Examples
**Print preview the entire report and do not delete Manuscript file when finished (all defaults used).** 

Renderer.exe "C:myReports\myManuscript.apm" 

Renderer.exe "myManuscript.apm 

**Direct print complete report and delete Manuscript when finished (no preview).** 

Renderer.exe /m:"C:myReports\myManuscript.apm" /d /q 

Renderer.exe /q /m:"C:\myOutQ\myManuscript.apm" /d Renderer.exe /m:"Manuscript.apm" /d /q 

**Direct print last page and delete Manuscript when finished (no preview).** 

Renderer.exe /m:"C:myReports\myManuscript.apm" /d /q /r:"*last" 

Renderer.exe /m:"myManuscript.apm" /d /q /r:"*last" 
**Print preview the first three pages and last three pages, do not
            delete Manuscript when finished.** 

Renderer.exe /m:"C:myReports\myManuscript.apm" /r:"1 - 3, *last-2 - *last" 

Renderer.exe /m:"myManuscript.apm" /r:"1 - 3, *last-2 - *last"
