A character expression may be a variable name, literal, or an expression containing variables and literals. 

### Remarks
An indicator variable can be used in a character expression, and is implicitly converted to character using the implicit conversion rules. 

### Example

```
	MyFieldName
        ¢Literal¢

        (MyLibName + MyFileName)
	(¢Literal1¢	+ ¢Literal2)
        (MyState + ¢¢ + MyZipCode
```
