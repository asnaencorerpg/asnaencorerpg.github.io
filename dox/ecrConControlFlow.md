Left unregulated, a program proceeds through its commands from beginning to end. Some very simple programs can be written with only this unidirectional flow. However, most of the power and utility of any programming language comes from the ability to change execution order with control commands and loops. 

Control-flow commands allow you to regulate the flow of your program's execution. Using control commands, you can write Encore RPG code that makes decisions and repeats actions.
