**General subroutines** are created because several different event subroutines may need the same actions performed. A good programming strategy is to put common statements in a separate subroutine (a **general** **subroutine** ) and have event subroutines call it. This eliminates the need to duplicate code and also makes the application easier to maintain. 

Once you have defined a **general** **subroutine** in a form program, you can call it from any of the event subroutines in that form.
