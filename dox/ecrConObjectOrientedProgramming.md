Objects are central to Encore RPG programming. Forms and controls are objects. Databases are objects. If you've used Encore RPG for a while, or if you"ve worked through the examples in this Help file, then you"ve already programmed with objects, but there"s a lot more to objects than what you"ve seen so far. 

In the following topics, you'll see how easy it is to create your own objects from the classes you define, and to use objects to simplify your coding and increase code reuse.
