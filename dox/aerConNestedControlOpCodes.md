You can place control commands inside other control commands, for example an <code> **If...Then...Else** </code> block within another loop. A control command placed inside another control command is said to be *nested* . 

Control commands in Encore RPG can be nested to as many levels as you want. It is common practice to make nested decision structures and loops more readable by indenting the body of each one. See the individual commands within the [Encore RPG Language Reference](aerLrfLangRefMain.html) for specific nesting structures.
