*Nonintegral data types* are those that represent numbers with both integer and fractional parts. The default nonIntegral type is ```*Float.``` 

Floating point numbers can be subject to rounding errors. Floating point types support fewer significant digits than ```*Integer``` but can represent values of greater magnitude. 

Floating point values can be expressed as ``` *mmm* **E** *eee* ```, in which ``` *mmm* ``` is the mantissa (the significant digits) and ``` *eee* ``` is the exponent (a power of 10).
