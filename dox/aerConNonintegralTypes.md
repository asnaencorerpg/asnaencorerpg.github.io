*Nonintegral data types* are those that represent numbers with both integer and fractional parts. The default nonIntegral type is <code>* **Float.** </code> 

Floating point numbers can be subject to rounding errors. Floating point types support fewer significant digits than <code>* **Integer** </code> but can represent values of greater magnitude. 

Floating point values can be expressed as <code> *mmm* **E** *eee* </code>, in which <code> *mmm* </code> is the mantissa (the significant digits) and <code> *eee* </code> is the exponent (a power of 10).
