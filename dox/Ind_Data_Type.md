The * **Ind** data type specifies that the variable is an indicator. 

When assigning resulting indicators, remember the following:

- Resulting indicators cannot be used when the result field refers to an entire array.
- If the same indicator is used to test the result of more than one operation, the last operation processed determines the setting of the indicator.
- The same indicator can be used to test for more than one condition depending upon the operation specified.
