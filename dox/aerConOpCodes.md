An *operation code, or command* in Encore RPGs is a complete instruction that can contain parameters, operators, variables, constants, and expressions. All op codes fall into one of two categories: *declaration commands* , which name a variable, constant, or procedure and can also specify a data type; or *executable commands* , which initiate actions. 

### In This Section

[Operation Codes Overview](aerConOpCodesOverview.html)

Provides a high-level look at operation codes, including how to have multiple
                commands on one line, continue a command over multiple lines, add
                comments, and check compilation errors.


[Assignment Operation Codes](aerConAssignmentOpCodes.html)

Describes operation codes that carry out assignment operations, which 	assign the value on the right side of the operator to the variable on the left 	side.


[Declaration Operation Codes](aerConDeclarationOpCodes.html)

Describes operation codes, or commands that name and define procedures, variables, arrays, and constants.


[Executable Operation Codes](aerConExecutableOpCodes.html)

Describes operation codes, or commands that initiate action by executing
                a method.  Executable statements can loop or branch through blocks of code, and often contain mathematical or conditional operators.
