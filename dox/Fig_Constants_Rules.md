When using figurative constants, keep in mind the following:

- After figurative constants are set/reset to their appropriate length, their normal collating sequence can be altered, if an alternate collating sequence is specified.
- Figurative constants are valid in Compare Operations, such as [CAB](CAB.html), [COMPARE](COMPARE.html), [DOUNTIL](DOUNTIL.html), [DOWHILE](DOWHILE.html) and [IF](IF.html); when the associated Field is the field with which the figurative constant is to be compared.
- Figurative constants can be used in compare operations as long as one of the factors is not a figurative constant.
