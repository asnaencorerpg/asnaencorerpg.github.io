***START** positions the file at the **beginning** of a file, so the [READ](READ.html) returns the 1st record. 

It is also used in conjunction with [*END](StarEND.html), which positions the file at the **end** of the file, so the [READP](READP.html) returns the last record of the file. 

* **START** /* **END** is only available with [SETLL](SETLL.html).
