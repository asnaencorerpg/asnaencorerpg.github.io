An expression can be thought of as a series of value-representing elements, separated by operators, that yields a new value. Examples of such value-representing elements are literals, variables, other expressions, and function calls. The operators act upon the value-representing elements by performing calculations, comparisons, or other operations. The end result of the expression represents a value, which can be either numeric, * **Boolean** , or * **String** .
