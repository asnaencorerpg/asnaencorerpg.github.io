In addition to storing values, a variable can refer to an object. You assign an object to a variable for the same reasons you assign any value to a variable: 

- A variable name is often shorter and easier to remember than the full path of
                methods or properties necessary to access the object itself.
- Using a variable that refers to an object is more efficient than repeatedly
                accessing the object itself through the necessary methods or properties.
- You can change a variable to refer to other objects while your code is running.
