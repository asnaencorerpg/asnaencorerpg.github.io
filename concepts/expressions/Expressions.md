An expression can be thought of as a series of value-representing elements, separated by operators, that yields a new value. Examples of such value-representing elements are literals, variables, other expressions, and function calls. The operators act upon the value-representing elements by performing calculations, comparisons, or other operations. The end result of the expression represents a value, which can be either numeric, * **Boolean** , or * **String** . 

### In This Section

[Calculating Numeric Values](CalculatingNumericValues.html)

Describes how to use numeric expressions, which contain literals and variables
                representing numeric values, as well as operators that act upon those values.


[Value Comparisons](ValueComparisons.html)

Demonstrates how to compare the values of numeric variables.


[Boolean Expressions](BooleanExpressions.html)

Discusses expressions that evaluate to the **Boolean**  values **True**  or **False** . 
                Also covers short-circuiting operators and parenthetical expressions.
