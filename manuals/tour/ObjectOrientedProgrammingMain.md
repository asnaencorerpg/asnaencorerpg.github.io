title: Object-Oriented Programming in Encore RPG



---

Objects are essential to Encore RPG programming, as everything is an object (forms, classes, controls, etc). 

In the following topics, you'll see how easy it is to create your own objects from the classes you define, and to use objects to simplify your coding and increase code reuse. 

### In This Section
