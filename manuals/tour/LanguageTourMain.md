                to simplify your coding and increase code reuse.


[Creating and Using Objects](CreatingandUsingObjectsMain.html)

[Understanding Classes](UnderstandingClassesMain.html)

Documents how Classes are important in object-oriented programming because they allow you to group related
                items as a unit as well as control their visibility and accessibility to other procedures. Classes also can inherit and reuse code
                defined in other classes.
