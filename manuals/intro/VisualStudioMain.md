Visual Studio is a complete suite of tools for building both desktop and team-based Enterprise Web applications. You will want to completely familiarize yourself with Visual Studio and its Documentation in order to fully use its IDE and vast resources, but as a debugging IDE it's intuitive enough that you can begin experimenting with it as soon you feel comfortable. 

> ECR's integration into Visual Studio means that ECR programs can only be developed on operating systems that support Visual Studio. A complete list of the hardware and software requirements can be found at [Microsoft's Visual Studio System Requirements ](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/releases/2022/system-requirements).
