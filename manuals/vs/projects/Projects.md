* Fully integrated [Git](http://git-scm.org) source code management.
* New Encore Project and New Encore Item template support.
* Encore RPG language service editor integrations, including source control `diff` displays.
* Encore-specific Solution Explorer commands and icons.
* Compile-time externally-described file definition caching.
