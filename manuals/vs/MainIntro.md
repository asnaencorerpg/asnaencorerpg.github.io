Encore for RPG integrates with Visual Studio, the industry-standard IDE for .NET applications, to create, build, and debug Encore libraries and apps, including console and web applications.

This integration leverages the .NET project system and Encore SDK to provide a rich .NET development experience to both Encore and C# programmers, including MSBuild and `dotnet` command-line development and production.

Additionally, Encore RPG for Visual Studio provides a simple command gateway to migrate Encore applications to first-class C# applications, free of Encore SDK.
